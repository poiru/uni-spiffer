**Spiffer** finds the [shortest path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem)
between two points in a hand-drawn graph. It acts my project work for the
following courses at the [University of Helsinki](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en):

* [Java Programming Project](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/courses/58160/2013/s/a/3)
* [Algorithms and Data Structures Project](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/courses/58161/2013/s/a/3)

**Disclaimer:** Several design decisions (such as using Java in the first place)
have been motivated by the requirements of the aforementioned courses.
